## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **Primary Choice**: GAT+RL with aggressive temperature regime
   - Best absolute performance (0.5481)
   - Robust across different seeds
   - Fast convergence (11 epochs)

2. **Resource-Constrained Alternative**: DGT-Super+RL with conservative regime
   - Best parameter efficiency
   - Fastest training time (~44s)
   - Acceptable performance (0.5781)

### For Research & Development:
1. **Explore hybrid schedules**: Combine benefits of linear_fast with aggressive exploration
2. **Investigate GAT architecture**: Why does GAT+RL significantly outperform DGT variants?
3. **Parameter optimization**: DGT+RL over-parameterization issue needs addressing

### Temperature Schedule Guidelines:
1. **For GAT models**: Use aggressive or fixed_high regimes
2. **For DGT models**: Use conservative or linear_fast regimes  
3. **General rule**: Linear decay schedules provide good baseline performance
4. **Avoid**: Fixed_low and balanced regimes (consistently underperform)
