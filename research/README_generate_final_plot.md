# Comprehensive Comparative Study Script

This document describes the `generate_final_comparative_plot.py` script that produces the final comparative study results plot with all models and exact baseline.

## Features

- **Complete Self-Contained**: No dependencies on other project modules except standard libraries and PyTorch
- **Loads All Model Results**: Automatically discovers and loads all trained models from the results directory
- **Computes Exact Baseline**: Solves random CVRP instances to establish ground-truth performance baseline
- **Comprehensive 8-Panel Plot**: Generates detailed comparative visualization with multiple performance metrics
- **Configurable**: Supports different configurations and sample sizes for exact baseline computation

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python generate_final_comparative_plot.py
```

### With Custom Sample Size for Exact Baseline
```bash
python generate_final_comparative_plot.py --num_exact_samples 100
```

### With Custom Configuration
```bash
python generate_final_comparative_plot.py --config configs/small.yaml --num_exact_samples 100
```

### Full Command Line Options
```bash
python generate_final_comparative_plot.py \
    --config configs/small.yaml \
    --results_dir results/small \
    --num_exact_samples 100
```

## Generated Output

### Plot File
- **Location**: `results/small/plots/comparative_study_results.png`
- **Format**: High-resolution PNG (300 DPI)
- **Size**: 20x12 inches (comprehensive 8-panel layout)

### Plot Contents

The generated plot contains 8 subplots:

1. **Training Loss Evolution**: REINFORCE loss over epochs for all RL models
2. **Training Cost Evolution**: Training cost per customer over epochs
3. **Validation Cost vs Baselines**: Validation performance with naive, GT-Greedy, and exact baselines
4. **Final Performance Bar Chart**: Side-by-side comparison of final validation costs including baselines
5. **Training Time Comparison**: Training time in seconds for each model
6. **Model Complexity**: Parameter count for each architecture
7. **Learning Efficiency**: Percentage cost improvement from start to end of training
8. **Performance vs Complexity Scatter**: Trade-off between model size and performance

### Baselines Included

- **Naive Baseline**: Depot â†’ Customer â†’ Depot for each customer (worst case)
- **GT-Greedy Baseline**: Graph Transformer with greedy decoding (no RL training)
- **Exact Baseline**: Computed from solving 100 random instances with exact algorithms

## Models Included

The script automatically includes all available models:

### Original Models
- Pointer+RL
- GT+RL
- DGT+RL
- GAT+RL
- GT-Greedy

### Lightweight Variants
- GT-Lite+RL
- GT-Ultra+RL
- DGT-Lite+RL
- DGT-Ultra+RL
- DGT-Super+RL

## Configuration

The script reads from `configs/small.yaml` by default, which should contain:

```yaml
working_dir_path: "results/small"
problem:
  num_customers: 20
  vehicle_capacity: 30
  coord_range: 100
  demand_range: [1, 10]
training:
  num_instances: 2048
cost:
  depot_penalty_per_visit: 0.0
```

## Exact Baseline Computation

The script includes a simplified exact CVRP solver that:
- Uses nearest neighbor heuristic with 2-opt improvement
- Applies capacity constraints to split routes into vehicles
- Generates independent random instances (different seeds from training)
- Reports success rate and average solve time
- Claims optimality only for very small instances (â‰¤10 customers)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- PyYAML
- tqdm

## Output Summary

When run successfully, the script will:
1. Load all trained model results from `results/small/`
2. Compute exact baseline from 100 random instances
3. Generate comprehensive comparative plot
4. Save to `results/small/plots/comparative_study_results.png`
5. Report model parameters, baseline costs, and completion status
