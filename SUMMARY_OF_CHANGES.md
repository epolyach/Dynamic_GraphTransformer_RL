# Summary of Validation Fix Implementation

## What We Discovered
Your observation was correct - validation costs were considerably larger than training costs (2-15% gap, average 2.34%). This was due to fundamental differences in how validation was performed compared to training.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Temperature Mismatch**: Training used temperatures from 3.5 down to 0.36, but validation always used 0.1
2. **Policy Mismatch**: Training used stochastic sampling, validation used deterministic greedy
3. **Limited Validation Diversity**: Validation seed only varied by epoch number

## Changes Implemented

### File: `src/training/advanced_trainer.py`
```python
# Before:
temperature=0.1,  # Low temperature for validation
greedy=True,
val_instances = data_generator(batch_size, seed=42 + epoch)

# After:
temperature=current_temp,  # Match training temperature
greedy=False,  # Sample from distribution, don't use greedy
val_seed = 1000000 + epoch * batch_size  # Ensures no overlap with training seeds
val_instances = data_generator(batch_size, seed=val_seed)
```

## Expected Benefits

1. **Reduced Gap**: Training-validation gap should drop from 2-15% to <2%
2. **Better Model Selection**: More reliable early stopping and checkpoint selection
3. **Accurate Performance Estimates**: Validation now reflects actual training performance
4. **Follows Best Practices**: Aligns with literature (Kool et al. 2019 and others)

## Key Principle Applied
**"Validate what you train"** - The validation should test the same policy that's being trained, not a different one.

## Next Steps

1. Run new experiments with the fixed validation:
   ```bash
   python run_training.py --config configs/small.yaml
   ```

2. Compare results:
   - Check if the training-validation gap has reduced
   - Verify that validation curves are smoother
   - Confirm better correlation between validation and final test performance
