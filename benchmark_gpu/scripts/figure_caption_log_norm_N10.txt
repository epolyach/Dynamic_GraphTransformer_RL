FIGURE CAPTION OPTIONS FOR log_norm_N10.eps/png
=================================================================

OPTION 1 - CONCISE (recommended for most journals):
Distribution of log(CPC) for N=10 CVRP instances solved using GPU dynamic programming. The histogram shows 100,000 random instances with the fitted normal distribution overlaid (μ=-0.748, σ=0.183). The log-normal fit demonstrates that CPC follows a log-normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p=0.189).

OPTION 2 - DETAILED:
Log-normal distribution analysis for the Cost Per Customer (CPC) ratio in 10-customer CVRP instances. The histogram displays log(CPC) values from 100,000 randomly generated instances solved optimally using GPU-accelerated dynamic programming. The overlaid red curve shows the fitted normal distribution with parameters μ=-0.748 and σ=0.183. The geometric mean CPC is 0.474, confirming that solution costs follow a log-normal distribution pattern.

OPTION 3 - TECHNICAL:
Histogram of log(CPC) for N=10 CVRP instances (n=100,000) with fitted normal distribution. The data were obtained using GPU-accelerated exact dynamic programming on randomly generated instances. Parameters: μ=-0.748, σ=0.183. The log-normal model provides a good fit to the empirical distribution (KS test, p=0.189 > 0.05), supporting the hypothesis that CVRP solution costs follow log-normal distributions.

OPTION 4 - BRIEF:
Log-normal distribution of CPC ratios for 10-customer CVRP instances (n=100,000). The fitted normal distribution of log(CPC) has parameters μ=-0.748, σ=0.183.

OPTION 5 - ACADEMIC STYLE:
Distribution of log-transformed Cost Per Customer (CPC) ratios for N=10 CVRP instances. Data from 100,000 optimally solved random instances using GPU dynamic programming exhibit log-normal behavior, as evidenced by the normal distribution fit to log(CPC) values (μ=-0.748, σ=0.183, KS p-value=0.189).

=================================================================
RECOMMENDED: Option 1 (Concise) - provides essential information without being overly verbose.
