  - Handles C=20, C=30, and other capacities
  
- `gpu_cvrp_solver_scip_optimal_fixed.py` - **SCIP MIP solver**
  - Mixed Integer Programming approach
  - Industry-standard solver backend

#### 3. **Utility Scripts** (1 file)
- `run_scip_n10_c30_1000.py` - **Production SCIP runner**
  - Specialized for 1000 instance runs
  - Progress monitoring and result saving

### Files ARCHIVED (13 files):

#### Moved to: `../archive/20250909/`

**Obsolete heuristic versions (3 files):**
- `benchmark_gpu_heuristic_gls.py` (old version)
- `benchmark_gpu_heuristic_improved.py` (superseded)
- `benchmark_gpu_heuristic_multi.py` (superseded)

**Obsolete benchmark scripts (4 files):**
- `benchmark_gpu_10k.py` (old)
- `benchmark_gpu_adaptive_n.py` (old)  
- `benchmark_gpu_exact_matched.py` (old)
- `benchmark_gpu_dp_exact.py` (old/buggy)

**Buggy/experimental exact solvers (6 files):**
- `gpu_cvrp_solver_truly_optimal.py` - **BUGGY** (num_vehicles always 1)
- `gpu_cvrp_solver_truly_optimal_backup.py` (backup of buggy version)
- `gpu_cvrp_optimal_v2.py` (experimental, unfinished)
- `gpu_cvrp_optimal_v2_fixed.py` (experimental, indexing bug)
- `gpu_cvrp_solver_scip_optimal.py` (old version, CVRPSolution issues)

## Key Bug Fix Applied

### **Critical Bug in Original DP Solver:**
The original `gpu_cvrp_solver_truly_optimal.py` had a serious bug where **all instances reported `num_vehicles = 1`** regardless of the actual optimal solution. This was due to incorrect route extraction logic in the `_extract_optimal_routes` function.

### **Fix Implemented:**
- Created `gpu_cvrp_solver_truly_optimal_fixed.py` with corrected route extraction
- Now properly traces through the partition DP to extract all optimal routes
- Correctly reports the actual number of vehicles needed

### **Impact:**
- **Before:** All results in `gpu_exact_n10_results_20250908_184929.csv` show `num_vehicles = 1` (incorrect)
- **After:** Will correctly identify optimal number of vehicles (tested and verified)

## README.md Updates Applied

Updated the README.md to reflect the cleaned up file structure:
- Updated file paths to point to the `_fixed` versions
- Removed references to obsolete/experimental versions
- Maintained consistency with the cleanup

## File Count Reduction

- **Before:** 18 Python files
- **After:** 6 Python files (67% reduction)
- **Archived:** 13 files safely stored in `../archive/20250909/`

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Use the fixed DP solver** for production runs: `gpu_cvrp_solver_truly_optimal_fixed.py`
2. **Re-run benchmarks** to get correct `num_vehicles` counts
3. **Archive old result files** that were produced by the buggy solver
4. **Validate results** by spot-checking a few instances manually

The folder is now clean, organized, and contains only working, current versions of the GPU solvers.
