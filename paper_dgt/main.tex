\abstract{This paper presents a novel approach to solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using Dynamic Graph Transformers. We leverage the power of deep reinforcement learning to train an agent that can dynamically construct high-quality routes for a fleet of vehicles. Our model is evaluated on a set of well-known CVRP benchmarks, and we show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both solution quality and computational time.}
