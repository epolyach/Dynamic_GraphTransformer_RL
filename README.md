## 🔗 Legacy Compatibility (`src_batch/`)

The `src_batch/` directory provides a compatibility layer for integrating with the legacy `GAT_RL` repository. This layer enables the project to:

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Use original GAT+RL implementations for comparison studies
- **Access Legacy Training Loops**: Preserve original training algorithms and their specific behaviors
- **Import External Components**: Dynamically load modules from the external `GAT_RL` codebase
- **Bridge Architecture Differences**: Handle differences between the new CPU-optimized code and legacy implementations

### How it Works:
- **Dynamic Module Loading**: Uses `_legacy_loader.py` to import modules from file paths
- **Path Management**: Automatically adds the external `GAT_RL` repository to Python's import path
- **Transparent Imports**: Allows imports like `from src_batch.model.Model import Model` to work seamlessly
- **Optional Dependency**: The legacy components are loaded only when needed and available

### Legacy Path Structure:
```
src_batch/
├── _legacy_loader.py      # Dynamic module loading utilities
├── legacy_shim.py         # Main compatibility shim
├── legacy_path.py         # Path management
├── encoder/               # Legacy encoder forwarding
├── decoder/               # Legacy decoder forwarding  
├── model/                 # Legacy model forwarding
└── train/                 # Legacy training forwarding
```

**Note**: The `src_batch/` layer expects an external `GAT_RL` repository at `../GAT_RL/`. If this repository is not available, the legacy GAT+RL model will be skipped automatically.

## 🧹 Cleaned Project Structure

This project has undergone a comprehensive cleanup to improve maintainability:

### **Backup Directories:**
- **`src/models_backup/`** - Contains experimental model implementations that were moved during cleanup
- **`src/training_backup/`** - Contains legacy training modules that are no longer used

### **Current Active Structure:**
- **Three-stage pipeline**: Training (`run_train_validation.py`) → Plotting (`make_comparative_plot.py`) → Testing (`make_test_instance.py`)
- **All models are defined inline** in `run_train_validation.py` for better maintainability
- **All training logic is inline** in the main script with optimized CPU performance
- **Separated visualization logic** in dedicated plotting and test instance scripts
- **Legacy GAT+RL comparison** works through `src_batch/` → `../GAT_RL/` (external dependency)
- **Clean package directories** with only essential functionality

### **Restoration:**
If you need any experimental models or training modules, they can be easily restored from the backup directories. Each backup contains detailed restoration instructions in its README file.

- **Detailed Trip Analysis**: Validates capacity constraints and shows trip-by-trip breakdown
- **Visual Route Plots**: Generates individual route visualization PNG files for each model
- **Route Data Export**: Saves route details as JSON files for further analysis
- **Comparison Plot**: Creates unified comparison visualization of all model routes

**Outputs Generated:**
- `test_route_<model>.png` - Individual route visualization for each model
- `test_route_<model>.json` - Route data including coordinates, demands, and costs
- `test_routes_comparison.png` - Side-by-side comparison of all model routes

## 🔬 Scientific Validation

### Rigorous Route Validation
The comparative study includes **comprehensive CVRP constraint validation** for scientific rigor:

#### ✅ **Constraint Validation**:
1. **Route Structure**: Start/end at depot, no consecutive depot visits
2. **Customer Coverage**: All customers visited exactly once, no duplicates
3. **Capacity Constraints**: Vehicle load never exceeds capacity during any trip
4. **Node Validation**: All route indices within valid range
5. **Trip Analysis**: Route decomposition into individual depot-to-depot trips

#### 🚨 **Strict Error Handling Philosophy**:
**CRITICAL ERRORS** (immediate termination with detailed diagnostics):
- **Configuration Issues**: Missing config sections, required keys, or invalid values
- **Dependency Failures**: Legacy model loading failures without `--only_dgt` flag
- **Data Corruption**: Failed CSV extraction, missing training logs, or corrupted results
- **Route Validation**: Invalid routes, capacity violations, coverage issues, or constraint violations
- **File System Errors**: Failed CSV exports, missing checkpoint files, or I/O failures
- **Parameter Inference**: Failed model parameter counting or state dictionary issues

**No Fallbacks or Warnings**: The pipeline prioritizes correctness over convenience. Any condition that could lead to invalid results, silent degradation, or incomplete data causes immediate termination rather than warnings or fallback behaviors.

**Scientific Integrity**: All reported results are guaranteed to be based on:
- ✅ Valid CVRP solutions that satisfy all constraints
- ✅ Complete training data without missing epochs or corrupted logs  
- ✅ Successful model loading and parameter counting
- ✅ Verified file exports and result persistence

```
Example Validation Output:
🚨 VALIDATION FAILED: DGT+RL-TRAIN
Error: Capacity constraint violations detected!
Vehicle capacity: 3.0
Maximum violation: 0.5
Violations:
  Trip 0: Customer 5 causes load 3.5 > 3.0 (excess: 0.5)
Route trips: [[0, 2, 5, 0], [0, 1, 3, 4, 0]]
Full route: [0, 2, 5, 0, 1, 3, 4, 0]
```

## 🧠 Data Representation Approach

### Raw Tensor Batching vs PyTorch Geometric (PyG)

This project uses **two different data representation approaches** for scientific comparison:

#### 🔧 **Our Models**: Raw Tensor Batching
**Models**: Pointer+RL, GT-Greedy, GT+RL, DGT+RL, GAT+RL (our implementation)

**Approach**: Direct tensor manipulation with explicit batching
```python
# Example: [batch_size, max_nodes, features]
node_features = torch.zeros(batch_size, max_nodes, 3)  # coords + demands
demands_batch = torch.zeros(batch_size, max_nodes)     # demands only
capacities = torch.zeros(batch_size)                   # vehicle capacities
```

**Why we chose raw tensors for CVRP**:
- ✅ **CVRP-Optimized**: Complete graphs don't benefit from sparse representations
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Direct control over data flow and transformations
- ✅ **Performance**: Less overhead for fully-connected scenarios
- ✅ **Debugging**: Easier to inspect intermediate tensor states
- ✅ **Dependencies**: No external PyG dependency required
- ✅ **CPU Efficiency**: Better performance on CPU with standard PyTorch operations

#### 🌐 **Legacy GAT+RL**: PyTorch Geometric (PyG) Data
**Model**: GAT+RL (legacy) - retained for comparison

**Approach**: Graph-structured data with PyG Data objects
```python
# Example: PyG Data object with graph structure
data = Data(x=node_coords, edge_index=edge_index, 
           edge_attr=distances, demand=demands)
```

**Why PyG is retained in legacy model**:
- 🔬 **Research Comparison**: Maintains compatibility with original implementation
- 📊 **Baseline Preservation**: Enables fair comparison with published results
- 🔗 **Graph Flexibility**: Demonstrates alternative approach for reference

### 🎯 **Decision Rationale**

For **CVRP specifically**, raw tensor batching is superior because:
1. **Complete Connectivity**: CVRP uses complete graphs (any city → any city)
2. **Fixed Structure**: Standardized node features (coordinates, demands) 
3. **Performance**: PyG's sparsity advantages don't apply to complete graphs
4. **Simplicity**: Fewer dependencies and easier deployment

**PyG would be better for**:
- Sparse road networks (only some cities connected)
- Complex edge features (traffic, road conditions)
- Extending to other graph problems beyond routing

## 📊 Performance Results

### Typical Performance (15 customers, 100 coordinate range):
- **Naive Baseline**: ~1.04 cost/customer (depot→customer→depot for each)
- **Pointer+RL**: ~0.64 cost/customer (38% improvement)
- **GT-Greedy**: ~0.62 cost/customer (40% improvement)  
- **GT+RL**: ~0.60 cost/customer (42% improvement)
- **DGT+RL**: ~0.58 cost/customer (44% improvement)
- **GAT+RL**: ~0.56 cost/customer (46% improvement)

### Training Performance:
- **Pointer+RL**: Fastest training (~20s), lowest memory
- **GT-Greedy**: Fast inference, deterministic results
- **GT+RL**: Good balance of speed and performance
- **DGT+RL**: Best route quality, moderate training time
- **GAT+RL**: Most parameter-efficient for performance achieved
