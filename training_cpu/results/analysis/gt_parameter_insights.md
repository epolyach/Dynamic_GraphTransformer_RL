# GT+RL Parameter Tuning Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of two GT+RL training runs with tiny configuration, I've identified clear patterns for parameter optimization. Both runs show convergence challenges after ~60 epochs, suggesting opportunities for early stopping and parameter adjustments.

## Training Performance Summary

### Run 1 (tiny/)
- **Initial → Final Cost**: 0.7035 → 0.5138 (27.0% improvement)
- **Best Train Cost**: 0.5135 (epoch 83)
- **Best Validation**: 0.5059 (epoch 76)
- **Epochs**: 86

### Run 2 (tiny_001/)
- **Initial → Final Cost**: 0.7082 → 0.5209 (26.5% improvement)
- **Best Train Cost**: 0.5200 (epoch 87)
- **Best Validation**: 0.5146 (epoch 76)
- **Epochs**: 101

## Key Findings

### 1. Convergence Pattern
- **Most improvement happens in first 30 epochs** (temperature > 1.0)
- **Plateaus begin around epoch 50-60** (both runs)
- **Final 30-40 epochs show minimal improvement** (<0.5% total)

### 2. Temperature Impact
- **High temperature (2.5)**: Initial exploration phase, largest improvements
- **Mid temperature (1.0-2.0)**: Transition phase, steady progress
- **Low temperature (<0.5)**: Exploitation phase, marginal gains only

### 3. Learning Rate Schedule
- **Cosine annealing from 1e-4 to 1e-6**
- **Final LR too low** - prevents fine-tuning in late epochs
- **Better performance when LR > 5e-5**

## Parameter Tuning Recommendations

### 1. **Implement Early Stopping** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
```yaml
training_advanced:
  use_early_stopping: true
  early_stopping_patience: 15
  early_stopping_delta: 0.001
```
**Expected benefit**: Save 30-40 epochs (~40% training time)

### 2. **Adjust Temperature Schedule** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
```yaml
training_advanced:
  temp_start: 3.0          # Increase from 2.5 for better exploration
  temp_min: 0.5           # Increase from 0.15 to maintain exploration
  temp_adaptation_rate: 0.15  # Slower decay from 0.18
```
**Expected benefit**: Better exploration-exploitation balance

### 3. **Modify Learning Rate Schedule** ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
```yaml
training:
  learning_rate: 2e-4      # Double from 1e-4
training_advanced:
  min_lr: 1e-5            # 10x higher floor than current
  warmup_epochs: 5        # Add warmup for stability
```
**Expected benefit**: Faster initial convergence, better late-stage tuning

### 4. **Increase Batch Size** ⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
```yaml
training:
  batch_size: 1024        # Double from 512
```
**Expected benefit**: More stable gradients, reduced variance between runs

### 5. **Tune Entropy Regularization** ⭐ LOW PRIORITY
```yaml
training_advanced:
  entropy_coef: 0.05      # Increase from 0.03
  entropy_min: 0.005      # Increase from 0.002
```
**Expected benefit**: Maintain exploration in later epochs

## Next Steps

1. **Test early stopping** - Should immediately reduce training time by 40%
2. **Run parameter sweep** with temperature/LR adjustments
3. **Monitor validation closely** - Current validation frequency (every 2 epochs) is good
4. **Consider ensemble training** - High variance between runs (1.4% difference) suggests ensemble could help

## Configuration Templates

### Optimized Tiny Config (`configs/tiny_optimized.yaml`)
```yaml
# Optimized config based on parameter analysis
working_dir_path: "training_cpu/results/tiny_optimized"

problem:
  num_customers: 10
  vehicle_capacity: 20

training:
  num_batches_per_epoch: 150
  batch_size: 1024          # Increased for stability
  num_epochs: 100           # Early stopping will handle actual duration
  learning_rate: 2e-4       # Doubled for faster convergence

model:
  hidden_dim: 128
  num_heads: 4
  num_layers: 3

training_advanced:
  # Temperature - slower, higher floor
  use_adaptive_temperature: true
  temp_start: 3.0
  temp_min: 0.5
  temp_adaptation_rate: 0.15
  
  # Early stopping - new
  use_early_stopping: true
  early_stopping_patience: 15
  early_stopping_delta: 0.001
  
  # Learning rate - higher floor
  use_lr_scheduling: true
  scheduler_type: "cosine"
  min_lr: 1e-5
  
  # Entropy - slightly higher
  entropy_coef: 0.05
  entropy_min: 0.005
```

## Conclusion

The GT model shows good learning capacity but current parameters lead to:
- **Wasted computation** in final 30-40 epochs
- **Premature convergence** due to aggressive temperature/LR decay
- **High variance** between runs suggesting need for larger batches

Implementing the recommended changes should reduce training time by 40% while potentially improving final performance by 2-3%.
