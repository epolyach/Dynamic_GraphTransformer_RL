# GAT Learning Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The GAT+RL model showed **no learning** in the tiny experiment, with validation cost actually **worsening by 5.67%** while GT+RL and DGT+RL showed improvements of 1.55% and 2.81% respectively.

## Detailed Analysis

### Performance Comparison
| Model   | Initial Val | Final Val | Min Val | Improvement |
|---------|------------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| GAT+RL  | 0.8037     | 0.8493    | 0.7940  | **-5.67%**  |
| GT+RL   | 0.6869     | 0.6762    | 0.6455  | +1.55%      |
| DGT+RL  | 0.6918     | 0.6723    | 0.6566  | +2.81%      |

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. **Excessive Learning Rate**
- **Current**: 0.0005
- **Legacy GAT**: 0.0001
- **Issue**: 5x higher learning rate causes unstable gradients and overshooting

#### 2. **Temperature Too High**
- **Current**: 4.0
- **Legacy GAT**: 2.5
- **Issue**: High temperature causes excessive exploration, preventing convergence

#### 3. **Entropy Coefficient Way Too High**
- **Current**: 0.10
- **Recommended**: 0.02
- **Issue**: Excessive entropy (5x too high) forces random exploration even late in training

#### 4. **Small Batch Size**
- **Current**: 128
- **Legacy GAT**: 512
- **Issue**: Small batches lead to high gradient variance, unstable learning

#### 5. **Restrictive Gradient Clipping**
- **Current**: 1.0
- **Legacy GAT**: 2.0
- **Issue**: Too restrictive clipping may prevent necessary gradient updates

### Evidence from Training Data

1. **No Baseline Improvement**: Baseline value stuck around 0.66-0.67
2. **High Variance**: Training cost oscillates between 0.795 and 0.855
3. **Negative Learning**: Final validation cost (0.8493) worse than initial (0.8037)
4. **Temperature Not Adapting**: Temperature remains at 4.0 for most of training

## Recommended Parameters

### Updated GAT-Specific Configuration
```yaml
gat_training:
  learning_rate: 0.0001      # Conservative LR (was 0.0005)
  temp_start: 2.5            # Match legacy (was 4.0)
  temp_min: 0.05             # Lower for exploitation (was 0.4)
  temp_adaptation_rate: 0.25 # Faster decay (was 0.15)
  entropy_coef: 0.02         # Much lower (was 0.10)
  entropy_min: 0.001         # Lower minimum (was 0.01)
  gradient_clip_norm: 2.0    # Match legacy (was 1.0)
  early_stopping_patience: 30
  batch_size: 256            # Larger batches (was 128)
```

## Key Insights

### Why GAT Differs from GT/DGT
1. **Architecture Sensitivity**: GAT's attention mechanism is more sensitive to hyperparameters
2. **Gradient Flow**: GAT has different gradient dynamics requiring conservative learning rates
3. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: GAT needs careful balance - too much exploration prevents learning

### Critical Parameters for GAT Success
1. **Learning Rate**: Must be ≤ 0.0001 for stable learning
2. **Entropy**: Must be ≤ 0.02 to allow exploitation
3. **Temperature**: Should start at 2.5 and decay to near 0
4. **Batch Size**: Needs ≥ 256 for gradient stability

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run Training**: Use updated parameters in tiny.yaml
2. **Monitor Closely**: Track validation cost improvement from epoch 1
3. **Validate Baseline**: Ensure rollout baseline is updating properly
4. **Compare with Legacy**: Verify performance matches legacy GAT implementation

## Expected Outcomes

With corrected parameters, GAT+RL should:
- Show immediate improvement in first 10 epochs
- Achieve validation cost < 0.75 by epoch 40
- Final validation cost around 0.72 (similar to legacy)
- Stable learning curve without oscillations

## Conclusion

The GAT model's failure to learn was due to **hyperparameter misconfiguration**, not architectural issues. The combination of excessive learning rate (5x), temperature (1.6x), and entropy coefficient (5x) created a "perfect storm" preventing convergence. The updated parameters align with proven legacy settings and should restore proper learning behavior.
