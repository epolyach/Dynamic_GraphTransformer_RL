# Tiny config - Quick experiments with reduced training
# Same problem as small (N=10) but reduced training data

problem:
  num_customers: 10
  vehicle_capacity: 20

training:
  num_batches_per_epoch: 500  # Paper's scale: 768,000 instances per epoch
  batch_size: 512             # Default batch size (paper's value)
  num_epochs: 60              # Default number of epochs

# Smaller model for faster training
